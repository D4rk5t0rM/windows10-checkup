# Doing a Deep Dive Checkup on Windows 10

***This is a FORK of Titus Tech's version of the script***
- Modifications:
    - Added automation by running the script `start.bat`. This will generate a `checkup.txt` file that has the output of the `checkup.bat` content.
    - `checkup.bat` has been modified so that manual interaction is not needed anymore.


Official Video: 

The `checkup.bat` file can be run from Command Prompt or Powershell

It will pause after each section and here are two more utilities I use all for the checkup
